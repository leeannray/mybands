        <hr>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace">We all know the name Bob Dylan. The name Dylan is iconic in the world of music. "Dylan" is associated with lyrical genius and symbolic protest. However, before Columbia Records discovered the giant that is now known as "Bob Dylan," Dylan was known simply as Bobby Zimmerman.</p>

        <h2 style="font-family: Verdana;">Early Years</h2>
        <hr>
        <p style="font-family: Courier;">The change from "Zimmerman" to "Dylan" was a sign of the musician's disposal of the "old" and the adoption of the "new" reflects Dylan's constant recreation of himself and his way of creating music throughout his decades long career. He quickly shed his image of a skinny, innocent folk singer who emulated Woody Guthrie and evolved into the electric rock star. Then he transformed into the country music player, then the christian evangelist, then the hippie who wore face paint and vests, next a stylish crooner, and finally to our modern day version of himself, which is that of an icon.<br> Before Columbia records discovered the now iconic musician, "Bobby" had already changed his last name to Dylan while living with other folk artists in the ever-expanding musical metropolis that was 1960's New York.<br>There has been much speculation and public opinion circulating around why Dylan chose this surname. Yet, as to be expected of Dylan, he has never divulged the reason he so quickly abandoned his birthname to morph into the folk singer who sung and played like Woody Guthrie. Some have claimed that Bob decided on the name "Dylan" as he wanted to emulate the poet Dylan Thomas. Bob, however, has denied this and every other attempt to understand why exactly he settled on the surname "Dylan." Fans for decades have been obsessed with discovering the reason behind Dylan's namechange as if this would somehow give them insight into the musician's mind and the meaning behind his songs. Why has Dylan eluded us all throughout the years? He has notoriously avoided answering reporters' questions and has scoffed at those who attempt to dissect every detail of his songs. The answer to why Dylan adopted "Dylan" as his stage name is a simple one. He never wants to be in the same place, or play the same role, year after year. He continues to transform both his image and his music. This is the mystery behind Dylan and also is the reason why Dylan has created such diverse, complex, and brilliant music throughout the decades. He is a musical chameleon.</p>

        <h2 style="font-family: Verdana;">Columbia Records</h2>
        <hr>
        <p style="font-family: Courier;">When Bob Dylan was discovered by Columbia Records in 1961, no one at Columbia knew what to make of this small, almost  childlike, new musician. He was a novice harmonica player. Some say the worst. His voice was raspy and carried a twang, disguising his Minnesota roots. But, he certainly knew how to write songs and not just songs of love and dance but songs that projected a deep consciousness of the injustices of the 60's: the Vietnam War, the Civil Rights Movement, the rich and the poor.</p>

        <hr>
        <p style="font-family: Courier;">The image of Bob Dylan--that of a scrawny, young, broke, folk singer--would change over the years. With each new decade comes a new Dylan and with a new Dylan comes a new style of creating music.</p>

        <h2 style="font-family: Verdana;">The Legend</h2>
        <hr>
        <p style="font-family: Courier;">We have come to associate the moniker of Dylan with lyrical genius, a valiant champion of the downtrodden, and a musician who eclipses all others through poetic, emotional, sensitive, inquisitive, demanding, poignant, and meaningful melodies. We still, however, don't truly know who the figure is behind the Dylan mask. Reporters have struggled to define Dylan, to understand the lyrics behind his songs. Yet right when we think we fully understand Dylan and his music, Dylan adopts a new persona; he shifts into an entirely new role, playing music that clashes in style with our former perception of the ever elusive figure that is Bob Dylan. </p>

    Come gather 'round people

    Is worth savin'
    Then you better start swimmin'

        <h2 style="font-family: Verdana; color: dimgray;">Did You Know?<br>Fun Dylan Facts</h2>
    </header>
    <hr>
    <ul style="font-family: Courier; color: dimgray;">
        <li>Although Bob Dylan was raised in Hibbing, Minnesota, he was born in Duluth, 76 miles northwest of his teenage stomping grounds.</li>
        <li>Inspired by poet Dylan Thomas, Robert Zimmerman reinvented himself as “Bob Dylan” during his formative years at the University of Minnesota. Not until August 1962, however — five months after the release of his eponymous debut album — did Zimmerman legally change his name to Bob Dylan.</li>
        <li>During the recording of Dylan’s sophomore LP, The Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan (1963), tensions bubbled over between Dylan’s manager, Albert Grossman, and producer John Hammond. Brought in to replace Hammond, Wilson oversaw that record’s final four tracks. Wilson then worked as the sole producer of Dylan’s next three albums.</li>
        <li>Dylan identifies the slain civil rights leader in the song’s opening lines: “A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers’ blood.”</li>
        <li>Dylan had and has an obsession with motorcycles. With Dylan recovering from his July 1966 motorcycle accident, he convened four members of his touring band in the Big Pink House in West Saugerties — not too far from a little-known town named Woodstock.</li>
        <li>Dylan’s 1969 double-LP, widely considered rock’s first bootleg album, was titled: "Great White Wonder. The Trademark of Quality (TMQ) record label released "Great White Wonder" in July 1969. The LP took its name from its generic white gatefold LP cover.</li>
        <li>A young Bob Dylan proposed marriage to Mavis Staples. Dylan and the Staple Singers starred on a TV special for General Electric. When he bumped into “Pop” Staples in a food line during the filming, Dylan told the group’s patriarch he wanted to marry his daughter Mavis. Dylan later popped the question to Mavis, but she declined; in her eyes, they were both too young for marriage.</li>
        <li>Bob Dylan wrote music for (and acted in!) the 1973 film "Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid." Dylan had a small but murderous role as Alias in this Sam Peckinpah western, which costarred James Coburn and Kris Kristofferson. Dylan wrote music (including “Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door”) for both the movie’s soundtrack and its score; the latter was nominated for a “Best Original Score” Grammy.</li>
        <li>Dylan’s brief departure from Columbia Records resulted in his recording two LPs — Planet Waves and Before the Flood — for the record label Asylum. Dylan signed with David Geffen’s Asylum Records in 1973 after his Columbia contract expired. Even though "Planet Waves" would hit No. 1, Dylan was frustrated enough with Asylum that he returned to Columbia the following year.</li>
